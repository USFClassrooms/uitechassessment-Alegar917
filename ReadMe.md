# Technology Assessment:

This project is for Teams 1,2,3,4, and 5. </br>
The project is basically a Cart Application where you can see all the cart items and add a new item to the cart.</br> 
The project is divided into backend and frontend. **You will only create the frontend using the technology you learned (React, or Angular, or Vue). You will only interact with the backend via Restful APIs.**</br> 

## Backend
You will download the backend app and run it.</br></br>
a. You can run the backend app using a program like "Visual studio code" by opening the folder and clicking the run button.</br></br>
b. OR You can run the backend app using the terminal:
1. cd /BackendAppFolder (The folder containing index.js file)
2. Write "node index.js" to run the javascript file (you will see a message saying "Listening on port 5555")

The APIs that you will call are:
1. GET /list : API returns the whole cart list in json format
(You can test this in a browser by going to the url http://localhost:5555/list
2. POST /item/add : API that receives a new cart item as a json request and adds it to the current cart list</br></br>
{</br>
	"name": "ABC", </br>
	"description": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", </br>
	"price": 1, </br>
	"amount": 1 </br>
}</br></br>
**Kindly, note that all the fields are required to get a successful add request. Also, name should be of length greater than or equals to 3, description should be of length greater than or equals to 10,
and price and amount should be positive numbers.**

## Frontend
The frontend part is made up of 3 web pages.
1. **Home page** containing 2 buttons "Cart List" and "Add Item" and each button will navigate to a different page.
2. **Cart List page** will be navigated to when pressing the "Cart List" button. In this page you will send a GET /list request and show the data in a tabular format (not json).
3. **Add Item page** will be navigated to when pressing the "Add Item" button. In this page you will show 4 different input fields (name, description, price, amount) and an "Add" button. You will send a POST /item/add request and show that the request was successful.

**Kindly note that you don't have to show a good UI design, just basics**

## Github
You will get a github invitation to push your frontend app to, please don't change the backend code.

## Screenshots
Please take a series of screenshots for the frontend app as follows:
1. Screenshot of the Home page
2. Screenshot of the "Cart List page" showing the cart list
3. Screenshot of the "Add Item page" and make sure to show the data of the new item you are adding
